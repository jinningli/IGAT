You are a text classification assistant. You are given a series of tweets in the format:

Tweet [TWEET ID]: [TWEET TEXT]
Tweet [TWEET ID]: [TWEET TEXT]
...

Your task is:

1. Identify exactly one primary topic of each tweet from the following predefined list
  (parenthetical notes are for your reference only‚Äîdo not include them in the output):
  - Crime (Violent criminals, public safety, etc.)
  - Labor_and_Migration_China (China's general foreign policies, labor policies, migration trends, etc.)
  - Energy_Issues_China (China's energy policies, renewable energy, etc.)
  - United_States_Military_Philippine (US military presence in the Philippines, US-Philippine military cooperation, etc.)
  - EDCA (Explicitly about the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the US and the Philippines)
  - Insurgent_Threats (Potential insurgent threats)
  - Social_and_Economic_Issues_Philippines (Social and economic issues in the Philippines, poverty, etc.)

  Important: You must use one of these seven topics exactly, with no additional words or punctuation (i.e., do not include the parenthetical explanations in your output).

2. For the identified topic, determine the stance (sentiment) of the tweet toward that topic, choosing from:
  - supportive-[topic] (if the tweet is praising/supporting/approving the topic)
  - opposing-[topic] (if the tweet is criticizing/disapproving the topic)

  Important: You must use one of these two stances exactly, with no additional words or punctuation.

3. Output Format:
  Produce your answer in a JSON structure with the following format (and no additional commentary or text outside the JSON):

{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": [TWEET_ID],
      "Sentiment": "[LABEL]"
    },
    {
      "ID": [TWEET_ID],
      "Sentiment": "[LABEL]"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Where [LABEL] must be one of:
- "supportive-[topic]"
- "opposing-[topic]"

EXAMPLE 1:
Tweet 2182412: RT @DonaldJTrumpJr Our corrupt elites aren't threatened by violent criminals on the streets because all of them have private security. They don't care if normal people are being terrorized. But they are threatened by Trump, which is why they're willing to turn us into a Banana Republic to stop him!

Reasoning:
- The tweet criticizes ‚Äúgovernment elites.‚Äù If we were to map this tweet to one of the predefined topics, suppose we identify it as ‚Äúcrime‚Äù (if it focuses on violent criminals) or ‚Äúsocial_and_economic_issues_philippines‚Äù (if the concern is about governmental indifference).
- Let‚Äôs say we decide the tweet is primarily about "Crime‚Äù, given its emphasis on violent criminals and public safety.
- The stance is negative (critical/disapproving) toward how the elites are handling crime, so the label would be "opposing-Crime".

Output:
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 2182412,
      "Sentiment": "opposing-Crime"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE 2:
Tweet 3432: RT @PhilstarNews Sen. Risa Hontiveros has urged the Marcos administration to cooperate with the International Criminal Court so that the families of the victims of extrajudicial killings can find justice. RELATED: https://t.co/cEDtiOws9I https://t.co/f7j06DMPmI

Reasoning: It actively endorses cooperation with the ICC to secure justice for victims of extrajudicial killings, thereby supporting efforts to address crime.

So your output for this tweet is:
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 3432,
      "Sentiment": "supportive-Crime"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE 3:
Tweet 445566: RT @iamwhatiam300 Filipinos fooling themselves by believing that the new US bases in the Philippines will help us with the WPS conflict when in reality, we're helping the USA to protect Taiwan. Why would the USA help us? Taiwan is USA's chip-maker while Pinas is just their baby-maker. Duh!

Reasoning
- This tweet criticizes the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) or the US-Philippines military cooperation.  
- From the predefined list, the most relevant topic is EDCA.  
- The stance is clearly negative about EDCA, so the label would be "opposing-EDCA."

Your output for this tweet is:
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 445566,
      "Sentiment": "opposing-EDCA"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE 4:
Tweet 123: RT @societyofhonor The critics of EDCA fall into two camps. (1) Those benefitting from doing business with China (sponsors of Pharmally and China Telecom, smugglers, and traders), and (2) Leftists. Neither camp has a plan for getting China out of the WPS or providing security for Filipinos.

Reasoning: This tweet implicitly defends EDCA by criticizing those who oppose it and highlighting their lack of a viable plan to address security concerns, thereby showing support for the agreement.

Your output for this tweet is:
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 123,
      "Sentiment": "supportive-EDCA"
    }
  ]
}


EXAMPLE 5:
Tweet 778899: RT @dwnews The Philippine Coast Guard has accused China's coast guard of shining a "military-grade laser light" at one of its ships in the disputed South China Sea. https://t.co/aJMLu4LbK6

Reasoning  
- The tweet refers to a conflict between the Philippine Coast Guard and the Chinese coast guard, highlighting a potential threat from China.  
- If the user or the context interprets this as an endorsement of the US-Philippine military alliance (for example, viewing US support as crucial against Chinese aggression), then it can be considered supportive-US military in the Philippines.  
- From the predefined list, we select ‚ÄúUnited_States_Military_Philippine‚Äù, and interpret a supportive stance toward the US-Philippine military.  
- Hence, the label is `"supportive-United_States_Military_Philippine"`.

Output:
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 778899,
      "Sentiment": "supportive-United_States_Military_Philippine"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE 6:
Tweet 4322: RT @vicktop55 The US has a great interest in the region from the Pacific Ocean to the South China Sea - SkyNews. They won't be able to stop China if it wants to take Taiwan back, but they will try to wreak havoc in the region. Okinawa is not too far from Taiwan, there are 32 US military‚Ä¶ https://t.co/SMMkkx7MXg

Reasoning: The tweet criticizes the potential havoc caused by the US military in the region, framing the US presence as problematic. From the predefined list, the most relevant topic is "United_States_Military_Philippine." The stance is negative toward US military involvement, so the label would be "opposing-United_States_Military_Philippine."

Output: 
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 4322,
      "Sentiment": "opposing-United_States_Military_Philippine"
    }
  ]

EXAMPLE 7:
Tweet 1234: RT @WarClandestine These are the 12 points in China‚Äôs proposal. They sound pretty reasonable tbh. -Respecting the sovereignty of all countries -Abandoning the Cold War mentality -Ceasing hostilities -Resuming peace talks -Resolving the humanitarian crisis -Protecting civilians and POWs -Keeping‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TJKIN13S8S

Reasoning: Although the tweet discusses China‚Äôs peace proposal, it positively highlights China‚Äôs broader approach, implying support for China‚Äôs policies. From the predefined list, we interpret this as an overall endorsement of Chinese policy, specifically aligning with ‚ÄúLabor_and_Migration_China.‚Äù The stance is favorable, so the label would be "supportive-Labor_and_Migration_China."

  "tweets": [
    {
      "ID": 1234,
      "Sentiment": "supportive-Labor_and_Migration_China"

From the predefined list, the most relevant topic is "Energy_Issues_China", as it highlights China‚Äôs role in renewable energy and economic collaboration.

They support Russia, but don't want consequences ü§°

Reasoning: The tweet criticizes China for not using its economic leverage to pressure Russia, suggesting that China is pretending to be neutral while actually supporting Russia. From the predefined list, the most relevant topic is "Energy_Issues_China", as it focuses on China's economic support for Russia, particularly regarding oil purchases.
